# Web Scraping Challenge

A web application that scrapes various websites for data related to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

The [mission_to_mars.ipynb](./Missions_to_Mars/mission_to_mars.ipynb) Jupyter notebook file contains all of the scraping code for this application. Specifically, I used BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter to scrape the following information about Mars from the following websites:

* [NASA Mars News](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/)
  * Scraped the latest news title and paragraph text.
* [JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars)
  * Scraped the full size image url for the current featured Mars image.
* [Mars Weather Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en)
  * Scraped the latest Mars weather tweet from the page.
* [Mars Facts Website](https://space-facts.com/mars/)
  * Scraped the table containing facts about the planet. Then, used Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.
* [USGS Astrogeology Website](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)
  * Scraped the name and image url for each of Mar's hemispheres and used a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys ```img_url``` and ```title```. Then, appended the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list contains one dictionary for each hemisphere.

## <a name="app"></a> MongDB and Flask Application

After scraping the various sites for the information needed for the application, I used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

To do this, I did the following:

* Converted the [Jupyter notebook](./Missions_to_Mars/mission_to_mars.ipynb) into a Python script called [scrape_mars.py](./Missions_to_Mars/scrape_mars.py) with a function called ```scrape```, which executes all of the scraping code from above and returns one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.
* Created a route called ```/scrape```, which imports the [scrape_mars.py](./Missions_to_Mars/scrape_mars.py) script and calls the scrape function.
* Created a root route ```/```, which queries the Mongo database and passes the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.
* Created a template HTML file called [index.html](./Missions_to_Mars/templates/index.html) that takes the mars data dictionary and displays all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements.

The following are screenshots of what the final web application looks like after scraping data from the various websites.
